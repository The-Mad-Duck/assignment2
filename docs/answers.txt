2.	How many commits have been done to the repository (not only by you, but by anyone) so far? Write the git command you used to get this information (4 points)
8
git rev-list --count HEAD

3.	When was the README.md  file modified last? Write the git command you used to get this information (4 points)

git log README.md

4.	Mention two reasons why branches are used in a Git repository (4 points)
Branches can have different code from different dates
Branches can prevent merge conflicts

5.	What is the difference between git log and git status? (4 points)
Git status gives information about the current working directory, git log will display the commit history for your branch.

6.	What command would you use to see the commits where “Vehicle.h” was one of the committed files? (4 points)
git log Vehicle.h

7.	What command would you use to see the commits whose commit message contains the word “file”? (4 points)

8.	In the context of object-oriented programming (I) What is inheritance? (II) What is polymorphism? (III) What is encapsulation? (6 points)
Inheritance is when one class inherits the attributes and methods of another
Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take multiple forms
Encapsulation is the act of hiding information within an object (ex. private data)

9.	What is the main difference between the “Dictator and Lieutenants” workflow and the “Integration manager” workflow? (5 points)
Dictator and Lieutenants only lets one person edit the main repository, developers can only pull from it.
The Integration Manager workflow makes developers push to their own repositories instead and a manager decides what to take from each.

10.	How would a team of 100 developers benefit from following the “Dictator and Lieutenants” workflow instead of the “Centralized” workflow? (5 points)
Having 100 people means a lot of merge conflicts, so a dictator and lieutenants workflow would reduce this in the lieutenant repositories.
